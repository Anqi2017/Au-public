These scripts should help make the process simpler to 

Requirements:

Linux operating system

For Step 1 (processing PacBio raw data):

Software:
  1. A working installation of smrtanalysis2.3.0 from Pacific Biosciences
     (you need to know the path to the directory it was installed)

Data:
  1. The raw data from the PacBio sequencing.  This will be a .bax.h5 or a .bas.h5.
     The raw data must be store similarly to how it was generated because the
     smrtanalysis software will look for a metadata xml file in the parent directory
     of the .bax.h5 file.  

For Step 2 (error correction by LSC):

Software:
  1.  bowtie2 (this must be installed in your path)
  
Data:
  1.  The output folder of step 1 OR a fasta file of long reads for correction.
  2.  A list of short read files to correct in either FASTA or FASTQ format.

For Step 3 (assembling a set of long reads for IDP):

Data:
  1.  The output folder of Step 1 (processing PacBio raw data)
  2.  The output folder of Step 2 (error correction by LSC)

No installation is required.

The software can either be run in one step or three.

For example:
pre-IDP_all-steps.py --smrtanalysis_path ~/jason/Source/smrtanalysis2.3.0/ --pacbio_raw lr/m130518_040637_sherri_c100509492550000001823074508221372_s1_p0.2.bax.h5 --tempdir /localscratch/Users/weirathe/ --short_reads sr_1.fa --short_read_type FASTA --output all_out2

Will run all three steps at once.

Alternatively you can run the steps one at a time.  
If you only have the pacbio long reads, you can only run the first step.

./pre-IDP_step-1_process_pacbio.py --smrtanalysis_path ~/jason/Source/smrtanalysis2.3.0/ --pacbio_raw lr/m130518_040637_sherri_c100509492550000001823074508221372_s1_p0.2.bax.h5 --tempdir /localscratch/Users/weirathe/ --output test_step1

./pre-IDP_step-2_error_correction.py --short_reads sr_1.fq sr_2.fq --short_read_type FASTQ --step_1_folder test_step2

./pre-IDP_step-3_make_long_read_set.py --step_1_folder test_step1 --step_2_folder test_step2/ --output test_step3


Outputs:

The ouptut of Step 1:
  This folder contains folders
  ccs_hq/
  ccs_lq/
  subreads/
    which contain high quality CCS reads, lower quality CCS reads 
    (which includes the highquality CCS reads in the set),
    and subreads in both FASTA and FASTQ formats.  
  It also contains
  ccs_lq_and_longest_subreads_to_correct.fa
    which is the long reads that will be LSC corrected, and excludes the
    highest quality long reads.
  lr_nonredundant_uncorrected.fa
    which is a nonredundant set of long reads and can be used for
    downstream applications when short reads are not available.
  LOG 
    contains a description of parameters used and how high and lower quality
    reads were called.

The ouptut of Step 2:
  This is simply the output of LSC and more information can be found in the
  LSC documentation

The ouptut of Step 3:
  lr_nonredundant.fa
    This file contains error-corrected long reads and high quality ccs reads.
    And longest subreads where no CCS read was available.  This set of reads
    is nonredundant.  Only the corrected reads are included when lengths
    between full length corrected and corrected LSC outputs differed greatly.
    This is the set of reads that should be run for searching for fusion
    sites with IDP.

  lr_for_isoforms.fa
    This file contains error-corrected long reads, and includes both LSC full-length
    corrected and LSC corrected reads when their lengths differed and thus
    introduces some redundancies which can be tollerated by IDP.  This is the
    set of reads that should be used for normally running IDP.
